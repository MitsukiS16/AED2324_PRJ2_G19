# Air Travel Flight Management System

## Project Description

Air transport plays a crucial role in global connectivity, triggering significant impacts on mobility, trade and
cultural interactions. The physical distance between countries and continents is thus shortened by the efficient
interconnection provided today by the airlines around the world. The ability to plan and understand the
complex flight network is extremely relevant for travelers and companies, so that decisions about travel and
associated investments are as informed and efficient as possible.

In this context, the implementation of a system capable of facilitating access and understanding of the air
transport network becomes an important tool. The main objective of this project is precisely to develop a
flight management system for the air travel network of the airlines around the world that provides effective
assistance to users who wish to explore and plan travel. The developed system is expected to meet the
functional requirements, described in detail in this document, and to stand out for its usability and ability in
providing relevant information in an intuitive and accessible manner.

To achieve this purpose, real data will be available that covers information about existing airports, including
their geographic location, details about available flights, specifying departure and arrival airports, as well as
the operating airline. A comprehensive list of airlines is also available. In the dataset.zip file, you can find
all this information about a real air travel network. A detailed description of the provided dataset is given
below and the following figure was obtained from this dataset, illustrating the position of the airports and
existing flights between them

## Installation and Usage
